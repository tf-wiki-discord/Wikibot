|comment=The Wikia link removal (at least I presume this to be the culprit) created a whole bunch of invalid talk page links on talk pages, which are now in the Wanted Pages list. Removing the link mark-up while still indicating what the link was, will work too. So long as we get them off the Wanted list.
